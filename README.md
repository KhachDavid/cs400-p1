Instructions to Build, Run and Test your Project:
-------------------------------------------------
Since this project uses GUI Swing and JFrame libraries, it is not possible to open the GUI with a make run command. 
You would need to open the code outside the command line to use the frontend.

To run the tests, you can run make test.
To run a specific test run:
	make testFrontend
	make testBackend
	make testData

To clear the .class files, run make clean. 

Team Member Contributions:
--------------------------

Zhiyuan did an amazing job with the frontend. He really went over the line with the front-end design.
Abhimanyu was always available to debug and pair program. He is a really good team player.
Adilnur completed his responsibilites on time and very accurately. 

Overall, the team did fine. We were a little clumsy in terms of being systematic. Next time, we should have a strict deadline to avoid
last minute hassle.
